## **Overview**
- A Web App front end for the Sakila database
- The database models the data associated with a film rental business
- The Web App will provide data for 3 levels of user:
	- Visitor: Will be able to see all information about films and actors (anyone who accesses the Web App with no credentials)
		- Browsing for films and actors made easier
		- Able to search by a specific film title, actor first/last name or film category
	- Customer: Will be able to see their own account information including which films they have rented
		- Allows for personalised experience for each customer
		- Able to rent a specific film
	- Owner: Has all levels of access and can write to the database. Can see all customer information and films that have been taken out
		- Allows for organised control when it comes to owners
		- Able to update the information of a specific film
		- Able to delete a specific film


## **Technology**
- Spring Boot
	- As a Java-based framework
- Thymeleaf
	- As a Java-based templating engine
- My SQL
	- As a database

	- Including Mock testing
- Scrum Framework within Agile


## **Observations**
- The entire project was built in less than 3 days as means of learning how to prioritise requirements in an agile environments
- Altering a database was the main struggle we faced with due to numerous primary-foreign key relationships between tables
